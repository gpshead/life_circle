# life_circle

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) code
for a [WiPy](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/py-boards/wipy/)
to animate [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
on a [circular LED disc](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2477).

TODO(gpshead): git push the actual code and a sample animated gif to show from this README. :)
